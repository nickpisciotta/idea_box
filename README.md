## The Big Idea

A simple app to record all of your big ideas and visualize them in one central location.

This app is an exercise in manipulating the DOM using solely JavaScript and jQuery, while using Rails on the back-end for database management and serving assets.

The goal is to create an app with a seamless experience for the user (i.e., no page refreshes)

Simply give a title and body to your idea and click save. Your idea will be displayed on the page with the option to search through all the ideas you created.  

You also have the ability to UpVote of DownVote and idea to change its quality.

To edit an idea, click within the tile or body fields, make your edit, then click outside the field for the changes to persist to the database.
